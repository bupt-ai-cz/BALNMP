## Abstract

- Objectives: To develop and validate a deep learning (DL)-based primary tumor biopsy signature for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis preoperatively in early breast cancer (EBC) patients with clinically negative ALN.

- Methods: A total of 1,058 EBC patients with pathologically confirmed ALN status were enrolled from May 2010 to August 2020. A DL core-needle biopsy (DL-CNB) model was built on the attention-based multiple instance-learning (AMIL) framework to predict ALN status utilizing the DL features, which were extracted from the cancer areas of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast CNB specimens annotated by two pathologists. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were analyzed to evaluate our model.

- Results: The best-performing DL-CNB model with VGG16_BN as the feature extractor achieved an AUC of 0.816 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.758, 0.865) in predicting positive ALN metastasis in the independent test cohort. Furthermore, our model incorporating the clinical data, which was called DL-CNB+C, yielded the best accuracy of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.775, 0.878), especially for patients younger than 50 years (AUC: 0.918, 95% CI: 0.825, 0.971). The interpretation of DL-CNB model showed that the top signatures most predictive of ALN metastasis were characterized by the nucleus features including density (*p* = 0.015), circumference (*p* = 0.009), circularity (*p* = 0.010), and orientation (*p* = 0.012).

- Conclusion: Our study provides a novel DL-based biomarker on primary tumor CNB slides to predict the metastatic status of ALN preoperatively for patients with EBC.

## Dataset

Our paper has introduced a new dataset that includes whole slide images (WSIs) of early breast cancer patients and the corresponding clinical data. Based on this dataset, we have studied the deep learning algorithm for predicting the metastatic status of axillary lymph node (ALN) preoperatively by using multiple instance learning (MIL), and have achieved the best AUC of 0.831 in the independent test cohort. For more details, please review our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02222).

### Description

The dataset is collected and organized by the experienced doctors of our research group.

There are a totally of 1058 patients and they are divided into the following 3 categories according to the axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis:

- N0: having no positive lymph nodes (655 patients, 61.9%).
- N+(1-2): having one or two positive lymph nodes (210 patients, 19.8%).
- N+(>2): having three or more positive lymph nodes (193 patients, 18.3%).

Except for the WSIs, we have also provided the clinical data of each patient, which includes age, tumor size, tumor type, ER, PR, HER2, HER2 expression, histological grading, surgical, Ki67, molecular subtype, number of lymph node metastases, label.

The WSIs is provided with `.jpg` format and the clinical data is provided with `.xlsx` format.

The usage of this dataset must follow the [license](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/BALNMP#license). We have used this dataset for weakly supervised classification, and we do not limit the specific task types for your research. Please note that the dataset is only used for education and research, and the usage for commercial and clinical applications is not allowed.

### Annotation

Annotation information is stored in `.json` with the following format, where `vertices` have recorded coordinates of each point in the polygonal annotated area.

```json
{
    "positive": [
        {
            "name": "Annotation 0",
            "vertices": [
                [
                    14274,
                    10723
                ],
                [
                    14259,
                    10657
                ],
                ......
            ]
        }
    ],
    "negative": []
}
```

### Code for preprocessing

We have used the codes for extracting annotated tumor regions of all WSIs and cutting patches with fixed size from all extracted annotated tumor regions, and they may be helpful for your research. Please check the [code](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/BALNMP/tree/main/code) for more details.
